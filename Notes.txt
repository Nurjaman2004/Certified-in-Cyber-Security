If you're aiming to pass your Certified in Cybersecurity certification, I strongly recommend thoroughly studying the materials provided on the learning portal: https://learn.isc2.org/d2l/home If you have a clear understanding of all the topics, the exam should be relatively straightforward. However, if your concepts aren't crystal clear, there's a high likelihood of failing the exam. So, make sure to focus on understanding each topic thoroughly before attempting the exam.

Here is a playlist of YouTube videos. If you understand Hindi, I'm confident that this playlist will clarify all your doubts. Therefore, I highly recommend watching this playlist to ensure a thorough understanding of all the concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JItB8DV6N9w&list=PLGUeNZBVHcelqTgh7QsYWTKpTrO4qygi8

To assess your progress, I suggest taking practical exams. Take this exam and aim to score above 85 in your attempts. This will give you a good indication of your understanding and readiness:
